This is a simple website I created using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. 

Note: I have used this website for experience in hacking. I performed some Client-Side Validation attacks, XSS attacks and a CSRF attack. For more information about where these attacks occured please look at: Assignment 8 EC(1).pdf
